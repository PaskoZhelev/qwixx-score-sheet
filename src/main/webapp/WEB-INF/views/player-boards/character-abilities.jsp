					<div>&emsp;<strong>Double Dutch</strong>: reroll a second time all or part of the dice </div>
					<div>&emsp;<strong>Tina Turner</strong>: change one 3 into a 4 or one 4 into a 3</div>
					<div>&emsp;<strong>Magic Mike</strong>: tick a solitary box between two already ticked boxes
					 (e.g. if 5 and 7 are ticked, tick 6. But if 5 and 8 are ticked and 6 and 7 unticked,
					  you cannot use it to tick 6 or 7). <br/>&emsp;This power can be used twice in the player's turn
					   if the dice values enable two ticks.</div>
					<div>&emsp;<strong>Chris Cross</strong>: tick 3 boxes, using white+white and white+color dice values as usual, and then another white+color value</div>
					<div>&emsp;<strong>Miss Take</strong>: instead of marking a misthrow, tick one box following usual rules, but NOT the rightmost box of any row (red and yellow 12, blue and green 2)</div>
